        Besides watching sports, I also enjoy contra dancing (like square dancing), watching live music, going for hikes, and watching movies. During this class I hope to get a stronger grasp of JavaScript and want to become a React and Node developer (MERN stack) in the future.

        Front-end JavaScript really interests me but it's been difficult to learn it on my own. That's why I'm looking forward to this class.
